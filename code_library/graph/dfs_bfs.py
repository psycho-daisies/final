BFS / DFS

This program explores using Depth First Search and Breadth First Search to explore a graph of Nodes.
For the BFS algorithm it uses a Queue data structure to keep track of the nodes that need to be explored.
For the DFS algorithm it uses a Stack data structure to keep track of the nodes that need to be explored.
There is an included data file with an example graph to explore.


Algorithm:
    * Start at an initial node
    * Visit node
    * Explore neighbors
    * check for unvisited neighbors
    * visit neighbor node/s
    * if no more unvisited neighbors, go back to previous node
    * Repeat until all nodes are visited

Pseudocode:
def depth_first_search(graph, start):
    visited = [False] * len(graph)
    stack = [start]
    order = []

    while stack:
        current = stack.pop()
        if not visited[current]:
            visited[current] = True
            order.append(current)

            # Push neighbors onto the stack in the order they appear in the adjacency list
            for neighbor in graph[current]:
                if not visited[neighbor]:
                    stack.append(neighbor)
    return order

Time Complexity: O(V + E)
